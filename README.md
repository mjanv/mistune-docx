# Mistune Docx Renderer

A template docx can be specified which implies that:
* The template defaults styles will be used and can be tweaked to change the appereance of the final document (This template needs to have the following styles defined: `BasicUserQuote` for blockquotes, `BasicUserList` for lists, `BasicUserTable` for tables)
* The template contents will be used as the first page(s) of the final documents 

Markdown supported features:
* Paragraphs
* Bold and italic text
* Headers (level 1 to 5)
* Bullet lists
* Tables with cells containing simple text (normal, bold or italic)
* Blockquote (delimited by triple backticks)
* Code span (delimited by single backticks)
* Images
* Mathematical equations (using Sympy rendering)
* Link
* Page break

Every feature follow the common Markdown syntax. A list of examples can be seen into the `example\` folder. Please remind that special characters such as `%` or `"` need to be espaced with a `\` to be admissible.

## How to use

python generate_doc.py output.docx --template example/template.docx --files example/*.md
